What can I do with AI?

Prototype things and see how they impact behavior.

AI answering big life questions: should I have children?

AI writing interactive horror story (whatsapp bots).

AI penpall (fiction).

List open source AI libs and services.

All AI use same "theory of emotion" <-> philosophy of algorithms.

Training data: what to use, where to get it, who owns it?

AI as a new perspective on things/problems/solutions (not as the solution itself).

Neural feedback loop: AI recognizing emotions and sending feedback to make user aware of self (mindfullness).

Create images from words (like "Platonic", or rather Wittgensteinian, examples).

"Hipsterbar" digital doorkeeper (and ethical implications).

Human computing and gamification (metadata and trainingset creation, for example for Europeana): duolingo, recaptcha, RNA sequencing games, galaxy zoo, crowd crafting, mechanical turk, crowdflower.

Types of AI: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, rule based, natural computing, game AI, ...

Ethics, futurism, http://lesswrong.com/
